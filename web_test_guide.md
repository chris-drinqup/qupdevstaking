## 🔧 Technical Implementation Notes

### For Future Enhancements:

**The web tester currently simulates transactions** for demo purposes. To make it fully functional, you'll need to:

1. **Add real transaction building:**
   ```javascript
   // Replace the simulated transactions with actual Solana Web3.js calls
   // Using the discriminators and account structures from your program
   ```

2. **Implement proper instruction encoding:**
   ```javascript
   // Use the correct instruction discriminator: [48, 191, 163, 44, 71, 129, 63, 164]
   // Build transactions similar to your manual_vault_init_fixed.js
   ```

3. **Add proper error handling:**
   ```javascript
   // Handle specific Solana errors and provide user-friendly messages
   ```

### Quick Implementation:
You can use parts of your working `manual_vault_init_fixed.js` code to make the web interface fully functional. The structure is already there!
