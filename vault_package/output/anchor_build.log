error: failed to select a version for `solana-address-lookup-table-interface`.
    ... required by package `solana-program v2.2.1`
    ... which satisfies dependency `solana-program = "^2"` (locked to 2.2.1) of package `anchor-lang v0.31.1`
    ... which satisfies dependency `anchor-lang = "^0.31.1"` (locked to 0.31.1) of package `anchor-spl v0.31.1`
    ... which satisfies dependency `anchor-spl = "^0.31.1"` (locked to 0.31.1) of package `new_qup_staking v0.1.0 (/home/chris/krakenbot/pro/questakingpool/new_qup_staking/programs/new_qup_staking)`
versions that meet the requirements `^2.2.2` (locked to 2.2.2) are: 2.2.2

the package `solana-program` depends on `solana-address-lookup-table-interface`, with features: `solana-instruction` but `solana-address-lookup-table-interface` does not have these features.
 It has an optional dependency with that name, but that dependency uses the "dep:" syntax in the features table, so it does not have an implicit feature with that name.


failed to select a version for `solana-address-lookup-table-interface` which could resolve this conflict
