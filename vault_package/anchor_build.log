WARNING: `@coral-xyz/anchor` version(^0.31.1) and the current CLI version(0.30.1) don't match.

	This can lead to unwanted behavior. To fix, upgrade the package by running:

	yarn upgrade @coral-xyz/anchor@0.30.1

error: Found argument '--overflow-checks' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context

	If you tried to supply `--overflow-checks` as a value rather than a flag, use `-- --overflow-checks`

USAGE:
    cargo-build-sbf --verbose
